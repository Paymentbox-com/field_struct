# already carries the +untyped+, so the diff stays clean — meaning a
# regression would ship silently. Fail loudly instead.
#
# The usual cause is a bare stdlib name in a YARD type written inside the
# FieldStruct::Types namespace (e.g. +Symbol+ / +Array+ / +Hash+) resolving
# against +Types::Symbol+ / +Types::Array+ rather than the stdlib class.
# Fix: fully-qualify it (+::Symbol+).
